Create following class hierarchy:

                      Shape
                        |
                        |
   ---------------------+---------------------
  |                     |                     |
  Circle              Square                Rectangle

Develop a Generic class “Node” to work with different shapes, like circle, rectangle, square.
Node class contains:
⎯ An attribute area, which is to be initialized with appropriate shape’s area value by calling calcArea() method of the relevant class(e.g., Circle)
⎯ A method “compareArea()” to compare the areas of different shapes with wild-card parameter to determine which shape is largest or smallest in terms of area.
Formula to calculate area:
Circle: 𝐴=𝜋∗𝑟∗𝑟 where r is radius
Square: 𝐴=𝐿𝑒𝑛𝑔𝑡ℎ∗𝑊𝑖𝑑𝑡ℎ, where Length and Width are same
Rectangle: 𝐴=𝐿𝑒𝑛𝑔𝑡ℎ∗𝑊𝑖𝑑𝑡ℎ
