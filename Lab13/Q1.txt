Write a JavaFX application that allows the user to choose insurance options.
Use a ToggleGroup to allow the user to select only one of two insurance typesâ€”HMO (health maintenance organization) or PPO (preferred provider organization).
Use CheckBoxes for dental insurance and vision insurance options; the user can select one option, both options, or neither option.
As the user selects each option, display its name and price in a text field; the HMO costs $200 per month, the PPO costs $600 per month, the dental coverage adds $75 per month, and the vision care adds $20 per month.
Save the application as FXInsurance.java.
