Design a JavaFX application for the Sublime Sandwich Shop.
The user makes sandwich order choices from list boxes, and the application displays the price.
The user can choose from three main sandwich ingredients of your choice (for example, chicken) at three different prices.
The user also can choose from three different bread types (for example, rye) from a list of at least three options.
Save the application as FXSandwich.java.
