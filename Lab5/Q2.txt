Modify question (3) of Lab exercise 4, adding an interface called SidedObject that contains a method called displaySides(); this method displays the number of sides the object possesses.
Modify the GeometricFigure subclasses to include the use of the interface to display the number of sides of the figure. Create an application that demonstrates the use of both subclasses.
Save the files as GeometricFigure2.java, Square2.java, Triangle2.java, SidedObject.java, and UseGeometric2.java.

OUTPUT:-
Figure Type: Square
Area: 25.0
Number of sides: 4

Figure Type: Triangle
Area: 6.0
Number of sides: 3
