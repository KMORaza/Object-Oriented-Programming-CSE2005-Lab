Q4]
Herbertâ€™s Home Repair estimates each job cost as the cost of materials plus $35 per hour while on the job, plus $12 per hour for travel time to the job site.
Create a class that contains a main() method that prompts the user for the name of a job (for example, Smith bathroom remodel), the cost of materials, the number of hours of work required, and the number of hours travel time.
Pass the numeric data to a method that computes estimate for the job and returns the computed value to the main() method where the job name and estimated price are displayed.
Save the program as JobPricing.java.
