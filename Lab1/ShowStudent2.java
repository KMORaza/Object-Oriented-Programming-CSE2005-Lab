(c)
Create a constructor for the Student class you created.
The constructor should initialize each Studentâ€™s ID number to 9999, his or her points earned to 12, and credit hours to 3 (resulting in a grade point average of 4.0).
Write a program that demonstrates that the constructor works by instantiating an object and displaying the initial values.
Save the application as ShowStudent2.java.
