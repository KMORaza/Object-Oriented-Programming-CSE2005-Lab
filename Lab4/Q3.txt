Create an abstract class called GeometricFigure.
Each figure includes a height, a width, a figure type, and an area.
Include an abstract method to determine the area of the figure.
Create two subclasses called Square and Triangle.
Create an application that demonstrates creating objects of both subclasses, and store them in an array.
Save the files as GeometricFigure.java, Square.java, Triangle.java, and UseGeometric.java.

OUTPUT :-
Figure Type: Square
Height: 5.0
Width: 5.0
Area: 25.0

Figure Type: Triangle
Height: 3.0
Width: 4.0
Area: 6.0
