Develop a simple chat application between two users using "Send-Wait-Receive" protocol.
Once a user sends a message, he waits till a message is received from other user.
The users are "User1" and "User2". At initial stage of application, User1 is in sending mode and User2 is in receiving mode.
These two users are sending and receiving the messages alternatively.
⎯ Create a Chat class with two methods: sendMessage and recvMessage
⎯ Create two threads to represent two users, User1 and User2.
⎯ Use Interthread communication to exchange messages.
⎯ No need to maintain any chat history.
Example:
User1: Hi
User2: Hello
User1: R u preparing for exam?
User2: Yes
User1: Ok. Bye
User2: Bye.
User1(User2):Hi
User2(User1):Hi
User2(User1):Hello
User1(User2):Hello
