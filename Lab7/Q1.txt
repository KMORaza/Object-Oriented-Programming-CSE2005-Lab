Consider a supermarket and develop following classes â€“
Product: It has three attributes name, price, and discount. Supply appropriate getter and setter methods.
ProductBasket: It is used to hold bunch of products before purchase of products.
Sales supervisor observes that two product baskets are very similar and he want to duplicate the bill generation of first basket to avoid re-entering the products of second basket for bill generation.
Apply suitable Object Cloning to generate different bills even if few items are deleted in generation of second bill. Also ensure that second bill modifications will not affect first bill.
Write a CloneTest class and check if the applied cloning works or not with two objects.

OUTPUT :-
Basket 1 Products: [Lab7.Product@6acbcfc0, Lab7.Product@5f184fc6]
Basket 2 Products: [Lab7.Product@6acbcfc0, Lab7.Product@5f184fc6]

After removing a product from Basket 2:
Basket 1 Products: [Lab7.Product@6acbcfc0, Lab7.Product@5f184fc6]
Basket 2 Products: [Lab7.Product@6acbcfc0]
