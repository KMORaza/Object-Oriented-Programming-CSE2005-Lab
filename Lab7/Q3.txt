Allow a user to enter an integer to declare an array of double with specific size.
Java generates a NumberFormatException if you attempt to enter a non-integer value; handle this exception by displaying an appropriate error message.
Create an array using the integer entered as the size.
Java generates a NegativeArraySizeException if you attempt to create an array with a negative size; handle this exception by setting the array size to a default value of five.
If the array is created successfully, use exception-handling techniques to ensure that each entered array value is a double or not.
If not re-prompt the user to take proper input with suitable message.
The program should display each entered value and its distance from the average.
Save the file as DistanceFromAverageWithExceptionHandling.java

OUTPUT :-
