Write a program that declares a named constant to hold the number of quarts in a gallon (4).
Also declare a variable to represent the number of quarts needed for a painting job, and assign an appropriate value for example, 18 (default value).
Compute and display the number of gallons and quarts needed for the job.
Display explanatory text with the values for example, a job that needs 18 quarts requires 4 gallons plus 2 quarts.
Instead of assigning a value to the number of quarts, accept the value from the user as input.
Now, add exception handling capabilities to this program and continuously re-prompt the user while any non-numeric value is entered.
Save the file as QuartsToGallonsWithExceptionHandling.java.

OUTPUT :-
Enter the number of quarts needed for the painting job: 25
A job that needs 25 quarts requires 6 gallons plus 1 quarts.
